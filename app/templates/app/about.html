					<h1>About</h1>
					<h2>We are here for you .......</h2>
					<p>As a result the web application developed an effective approach to detect brain tumors using MRI image to aid in making quick, efficient, and precise decisions. The prediction accuracy was used to assess performance. In the testing data, the algorithm outperformed the current conventional approaches for detecting brain Tumors and achieved excellent accuracy.</p>

					<h2>Brain Tumor</h2>
					<p>
						In medical science, an anomalous and uncontrollable cell growth inside the brain is recognized as tumor. Human brain is the most receptive part of the body. It controls muscle movements and interpretation of sensory information like sight, sound, touch, taste, pain, etc.The human brain consists of Grey Matter (GM), White Matter (WM) and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and on the basis of factors like quantification of tissues, location of abnormalities, malfunctions & pathologist and diagnostic radiology, a presence of tumor is identified. A tumor in the brain can affect such sensory information and muscle movements or even results in more dangerous situation which includes death. Depending upon the place of commencing, tumor can be categorized into primary tumors and secondary tumors. If the tumor is originated inside the skull, then the tumor is known as primary brain tumor otherwise if the tumorâ€™s initiation place is somewhere else in the body and moved towards the brain, then such tumors are called secondary tumors. The source of brain tumors can be traced back to aberrant cells forming in the brain, some of which are precancerous, some of which are cancerous or damaging, and others which are innocuous or noncancerous.
